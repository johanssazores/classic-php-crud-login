  <p class ="healthyrecipetext">While eating fads come and go, there are a few key elements to healthy eating that remain unchanged.
   Healthy foods are those that provide you with the nutrients you need to sustain your body’s well-being and retain energy. Water, carbohydrates, fat, protein, vitamins, and minerals are the key nutrients that make up a healthy, balanced diet.
   Healthy eating means eating a variety of foods that give you the nutrients you need to maintain your health, feel good, and have energy. These nutrients include protein, carbohydrates, fat, water, vitamins, and minerals.
   Nutrition is important for everyone. When combined with being physically active and maintaining a healthy weight, eating well is an excellent way to help your body stay strong and healthy. If you have a history of breast cancer or are currently undergoing treatment, eating well is especially important for you. What you eat can affect your immune system, your mood, and your energy level.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Tilapia can get a bad wrap. It's not tender and fatty like salmon, nor is it firm and flavorful like tuna. It's sort of an in-between fish, and can often be written off as boring. No more! We're here to vouch for tilapia; it has so much to offer! It's lean and inexpensive, making it a great choice for your next weeknight dinner. Follow a few simple rules and take this affordable filet from zero to hero.</p>

          <p class="card-text">We're all for a genius low-carb hack — and these tomatoes totally deliver. We had never thought to stuff them with taco meat, cheese, and sour cream, but we'll do anything in the name of ditching a tortilla for a low-carb meal. You can change up the fillings for cheeseburger tomatoes, too.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Honey Walnut Shrimp is a classic dish from Hong Kong that many Americans know about thanks to Panda Express and many other. The dish is popular at many Chinese restaurants as well. Our version of this slightly sweet dish more closely represents the fast food version. Ones you may find in Hong Kong have very lightly battered shrimp whereas Panda Express has a thicker and heavier coating for that extra crispy bite. </p>
